# Heart_Attack_Analysis_-_ML

This project was completed as my final capstone for my BS in Data Analytics. This project aims to create a machine-learning model that achieves a prediction accuracy score of 85% or greater.

I achieved models that surpassed 90%.

I conducted an analysis and tested machine learning models on fictional data obtained from Kaggle related to a patient's risk of heart attack.
  Tested Models:
      -XGBoost
      -RandomForestClassifer
      -DecisionTreeClassifier
      -SVC
      -KNearestNeighborsClassifer
