# Heart_Attack_Analysis_-_ML

This project was completed as my final capstone for my BS in Data Analytics. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that achieves a prediction accruacy score of 85% or greater.

I conducted an analysis and tested machine learning models on fictional data obtained from Kaggle related to a patients risk of heart attack.
  Tested Models:
      -XGBoost
      -RandomForestClassifer
      -DecisionTreeClassifier
      -SVC
      -KNearestNeighborsClassifer
